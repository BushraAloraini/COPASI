<title>Error Messages</title>
<para>
This section contains a list of Copasi error messages and an explanation when and/or why this error might have occured. This is work in progress and not all error messages might have been fully documented here yet.
</para>
<para>
Also keep in mind that the vast majority of error messages listed here are internal to Copasi and users will probably never see them at all. If you see one of those, you know that there is a bug in Copasi and you should provide a bug report that is as detailed as possible. At the very least, the bug report should include a description of what you did when the bug occured, the operating system you are running Copasi on and the version of Copasi you were using. Naturally, if possible, we would also like to have some file that shows the error reproducibly since this makes finding bugs a lot easier for us. Error messages that you should never encounter will be marked INTERNAL in the description. So if you encounter any error message marked as INTERNAL please provide as with a bug report so we can fix it. There are two ways to provide a bug report. The first one is to go to Copasis <ulink url="http://calvin.bioinformatics.vt.edu/bugzilla/createaccount.cgi">bugzilla webpage</ulink> and create a new account if you don't already have one and enter a full bug report into the bugzilla database. The other way to report is bug is to send an email to bugs@copasi.org with the information mentioned above.

Optimization
Optimization (1): Object '$CN' not found:
The object specified by $CN can not be found. This normally indicates
that the model was changed and the parameters or constraints must be
adjusted. 

Optimization (2): Lower Bound '$CN' not found:
The lower bound specified by $CN can not be found. This normally indicates
that the model was changed and the parameters or constraints must be
adjusted. 

Optimization (3): Upper Bound '$CN' not found:
The upper bound specified by $CN can not be found. This normally indicates
that the model was changed and the parameters or constraints must be
adjusted. 

Optimization (4): Empty Interval ('$lower', '$upper') specified:
The interal is invalid as the lower bound is larger than the upper
bound. Please correct the problem.
 
Optimization (5): Invalid Objective Functions:
The objective function is invalid, i.e, COPASI can not interpret
it. Pleasse correct the problem.

Optimization (6): No adjustable Parameters specified.
Since no parameter are specified no optimization can be performed.

Optimization (7): No Task Type specified
The optimization task type is not specified. Supporte types are
currently time course and steady state.

Optimization (8): '$failed' Function Evaluation out of '$tried'
failed:
A high percentage of failed function evaluation indicates that the
parameter range is not appropriate or the objective function is ill

 <row>
   <entry>SBML (6): Annotations in SBML element of SBML Level 1 files, this is invalid and has been ignored.</entry>
   <entry>Some programs add annotations to the SBML element of the file which is incorrect. Since it doesn't affect the mode, Copasi reads the model anyway but ignores the annotation. If you want to keep the annotation please open the SBML file in a text editor and move it to e.g. the model element.</entry>
 </row>
 <row>
   <entry>SBML (7): One or more model values have not been set.</entry>
   <entry>In order to simulate a model in Copasi it has to be complete, meaning all initial values and parameter values have to be set. SBML allows the user to specify incomplete models. This warning tells the user that some values in the model have not been set and that the model is incomplete. Most tasks in Copasi will not work with this model until all values have been set. Unset values will be shown as NaN in Copasi graphical user interface. The fastest way to find unset values is to use the <link likend="parameterView">parameter view</link>.</entry>

   <entry>SBML (11): Function 'FUNCTIONID' does not start with a Lambda element.</entry>
   <entry>Function definitions in MathML have to start with a Lambda element. If you see this error, the function with the id FUNCTIONID is very likely incorrect MathML because it is missing this element.</entry>
 </row>
 <row>
   <entry>SBML (12): Function 'FUNCTIONID' contains invalid parameter list.</entry>
   <entry>The error message means that the parameter list for the function definition wih id FUNCTIONID contains an invalid type, e.g. a number instead of a parameter name.</entry>

   <entry>SBML (21): Setting an initial concentration on species 'SPECIESID' which is in a compartment with spatial dimensions 0 is not allowed.</entry>
   <entry>Having a compartment with a spatial dimension of 0 implies that all species within this compartment have the hasOnlySubstanceUnits flag set to true. Therefore it is incorrect to specify an initial concentration for those species. Specify an initial amount instead. Current version of Copasi refuse to read models with compartments that have their spatial size units set to 0 so this error message will never appear.</entry>
 </row>
 <row>
   <entry>SBML (22): Current versions of Copasi only supports three dimensional compartments. 'COMPARTMENTID' will be converted to three dimensions.</entry>
   <entry>Copasi only supports three dimensional compartments so far, so all compartments are converted to three dimensions no matter what is specified in the SBML file. Independent of this is the handling of spatial dimensions that are set to 0 in the SBML file (see error SBML (21) above). Current version of Copasi refuse to read models with compartments that have their spatial size units set to 0 so this error message will never appear.</entry>
 </row>
 <row>
   <entry>SBML (23): Unable to handle compartment 'COMPARTMENTID' which has spatial dimensions of 0.</entry>
   <entry>Copasi does not handle models that include compartments with spatial dimensions set to 0. This might change in future versions.</entry>

   <entry>SBML (26): Units for parameter 'PARAMETERID' ignored.</entry>
   <entry>Copasi ignores units set on individual compartments since unit cnversion is not supported in Copasi yet. Please be aware that depending on the units results generated from such a model might be incorrect.</entry>

   <entry>SBML (28): Error in function definition with id 'ID'.</entry>
   <entry>Somehow Copasi was not able to convert the function definition with id ID into it's internal format. If you think the function definition is correct, please send a bug report and include the SBML file.</entry>

   <entry>SBML (29): Unable to handle reactions with the 'fast' flag set.\nThe flag has been set to false.</entry>
   <entry>Copasi is not yet able to handle reactions that are set to fast correctly the flag will be automatically set to false on import. In some cases simulation results for these models can be incorrect.</entry>
 </row>
 <row>
   <entry>SBML (30): Can't handle units of type item with scale set to 1.\n If this file was created with COPASI RC1 or older please see the COPASI FAQ.</entry>
   <entry>Copasi pior to and including RC1 had a bug in the SBML exporter. If the default concentration units were set to itmes, Copasi would set the scale to 1 instead of 0 on the exported substance unit definition. You can correct those files by opening them in a text editor and setting the scale for the substance units to 0. If the file was not created with Copasi, the scale was probalbly meant to be 1 and Copasi can not import it since it does not do unit conversion yet.</entry>
