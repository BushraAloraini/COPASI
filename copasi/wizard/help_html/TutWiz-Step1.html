	<p>
Once you start Copasi, the first dialog you will see shows a tree on the left,
where you can select the individual elements of Copasi. The element that is
selected per default is the tree node that corresponds to the current model.
On the right side, you can see the settings for this model, which are the name of
the model, the units that copasi will use in the model and a description of the
model.
Here you should give the model a more expressive name and maybe a short
description.
