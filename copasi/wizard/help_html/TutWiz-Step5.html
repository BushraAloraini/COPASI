  <h3>Step 5: Calculating a Time Course</h3><br>
	</center>
	<p>
In the tree on the left under Tasks you can find the entry called <em>Time
Course</em>. Selecting this entry in the tree will bring you to the time course
settings dialog.<br>
<center>
(<a href="#" name="Time Course">Click here</a> to go to the <em>Time Course</em> dialog)
</center>
<br>
Here you can set all parameters for calculating a time course
like starting time, end time, how many data points are to be stored and last
but not least the method for calculating the trajectory. So far you can choose between
deterministic simulation or stochastic simulation. Depending on the simulation
method, you have some more parameters that can be changed in the table toward
the bottom of the dialog, but the default values should suffice most of the
time.

Before we can calculate the actual trajectory, we have to specify a report
definition to use for the output and a filename for this report definition. To
do this, you have to click on the <b><code>"ReportDefinition"</code></b> button at the bottom.
In the dialog that pops up, you choose the report definition that you created
in the last step and specify a file name in the <em>Target</em> field. You can either
type the filename, or browse the file system by clicking the <b><code>"browse"</code></b> button.
When you are finished, click the <b><code>"confirm"</code></b> button.
You are now ready to calculate the time course by clicking the <big><b><code>"Run"</code></b></big> button at
the bottom of the <em>Time Course</em> dialog.
To verify that copasi really did calculate something, look at the file you just
specified, it should now contain the data of the time course simulation.
