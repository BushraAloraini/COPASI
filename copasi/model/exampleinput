# This is a simple example input file for the COPASI specification
# file reader.

# The input must be given as follows: Each line must begin with a
# number and a colon, where the number indicates the compartment of
# the variable being described, or in the case of functions or
# differential equations, the LHS variable. Differential equations are 
# denoted with a '. Assignments use the equality '=' operator, while 
# rate constants use := . Variable initialization is preceded by the 
# keyword "INIT", while compartment volume specifications require 
# the keyword "Volume".

# This describes a simple system in compartments 1 and 2 in which a 
# is converted to a product in an enzyme catalysed reaction. The
# product can also diffuse from one cell to another.
# In compartment 3, an unrelated set of reactions occurs (mainly as 
# further illustration of the kind of systems we must be able to parse.
