  <h3>Step 6: Plotting</h3><br>

	<p>
In the object tree on the left in the <em>Output</em> node, you can find the entry
called <em>Plots</em>. Selecting this will bring you to the plot definition overview
which will probably be empty. <br>

(<a href="#" name="Plot Definition Overview">Click here</a> to go to the plot definition overview.)

If you click on the <b><code>"Add default plot"</code></b> button at
the bottom, a default plot that contains the concentrations of all metabolites
against the time will be created. To edit this plot definition, double click on
the entry.

In this dialog you can add more curves, delete curves or change the way
individual curves are plotted. Once you are finished with the plot definition,
you go back to the <em>Time Course</em> dialog and push the <big><b><code>"Run"</code></b></big> button again.
Now you a new plot window like the one below, with the concentrations of all metabolites on the y axis plotted against the time on the x axis, should pop up.
